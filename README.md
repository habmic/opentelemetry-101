# Observability in Cloud Native apps using OpenTelemetry

Welcome to the Observability in Cloud Native apps using OpenTelemetry
 repository! This repository contains a demo application that is being used throughout the Udemy course. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, the demo application will help you learn and understand the fundamentals of OpenTelemetry and Observability.


## Following the course code examples
This course is build an a way that we start with a simple application and every section of the course we will add more functionally of OpenTelemetry. 

To navigate between the different phases of the course I have used git tags. Below is a table with all the available tags (after you have cloned the repo it is recommended to checkout the first tag)

| Tag name  | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Before we install OpenTelemetry  |
| 2  | Basic OpenTelemetry installation  |
| 3  | Adding Metrics  |

## How to use this repo

1. **Clone the Repository:** 

```
git clone https://github.com/habmic/opentelemetry-101.git
```

2. **Checkout the first tag:** 

```
git checkout 1
```

3. **Running it with docker:** 
```

>The best way to learn is by experimenting and modifying the code. Try tweaking the code to understand how different configurations and scenarios affect the telemetry data.
